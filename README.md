# Service Trip
## Customized Service Trip Recommendations
### description headings and paragraphs
With this app, you will be able to find service trips that meet your preferences

Our communitites are more service oriented than we think they are! Problem is, we don't know where to find opportunities that meet our specific schedules, budgets, etc. In this app, you will be able to enter your very specific needs and get projects that match those.

## Business
This project targets people in religious or service oriented communities, more specifically, those who have limited time or money.

The functionality of this app is broad enough that it can be used by anyone who is intereted on service or travel

This would be a non-profit app

The team is going to be composed of two to three people

## Legal

Legal Documents needed:

- SLA service level agreement

## Technical
The code will be stored in a public repository
https://github.com/massielislas/serviceTrip

The DBMS structure for this project will include an SQL based system in which we store specific details about trips such as prize and location and will make them easily selectible depending on user specifications.
The information for the nonprofits, their media, and private details will be stored in a NonSQL system.

We expect to use MongoDB for our NonSQL technology.
